# FIFA_JSF

This project was writtten when I was new to JSF and PrimeFaces. It's primary use was to learn those tools.

It's secondary purpose was to store game results of online EA FIFA games played between 2014 and 2016. 

The database used was a MySQL relational database, normalized to 3rd normal form.
